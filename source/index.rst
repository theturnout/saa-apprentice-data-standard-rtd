SAA Apprentice Data Standard documentation
==========================================

Welcome to the SAA Apprentice Data Standard documentation. This version of the standard represents the current state of the data as provided by SAA states to the RAPIDS system. As a result, it is more descriptive than proscriptive and includes a number of values that are either duplicative or not documented. 

Subsequent versions of the standard will be more proscriptive in an effort to streamline the data collection process and ensure that data reported to RAPIDS is as accurate as possible.
